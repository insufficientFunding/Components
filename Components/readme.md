## Electronic Components

This project was created to make a simple workflow for creating electronic components for use in .NET applications. The
project is currently in the early stages of development and is not ready for use.

Basically all the code stems from Samuel
Fisher's [Circuit Diagram CLI](https://github.com/circuitdiagram/circuitdiagram) tool, which is a command line tool for
creating circuit diagrams. The code has been modifier to fit my needs and to be used as a library. I have also
refactored the code again to fit my coding style and to make it easier for me to use.
